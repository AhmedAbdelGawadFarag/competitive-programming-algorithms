1-  If some natural number is divisible by two relatively prime numbers p and q,
    then it is divisible by their product pq.

2-  If the number pA is divisible by q, where p and q are relatively
    prime, then A is also divisible by q.

3-  If n = p ^ a * q ^ c  and p and q are prime numbers the number of divisors = (a+1) * (c+1)

4-  Given the numbers A = 2^3 * 7 and B = 2^5 * 9
    GCD(A,B) = 2^3

5-  Given the numbers A = 2^3 * 7 and B = 2^5 * 9
    LCM(A,B) = 2^5 * 7 * 9 (you take the bigger power of each prime)

6-  if a number has an odd number of divisors, then it is a
    perfect square and vice versa.
    ex: 25 -------------->  5^2 so it has 3 divisors

7- a composite number is a number that has more than 2 divisors
